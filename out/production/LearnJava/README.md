# Java OOP Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Java programs demonstrating fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, string manipulation, and algorithmic logic.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. Student Grade Statistics (Exercise 1)
A program that manages student grades.
* **Features:**
    * Reads student grades into an array.
    * Calculates and displays the **average** grade.
    * Finds the **maximum** and **minimum** grades.
    * Counts how many students scored above a user-defined threshold.
* **Key Concepts:** Arrays, Loops, conditional logic.

### 2. French Verb Conjugator (Exercise 2)
A tool to conjugate regular French verbs (First Group ending in "-er").
* **Features:**
    * Takes a verb (e.g., "chanter") as input.
    * Checks if it belongs to the first group.
    * Prints the present tense conjugation for all pronouns (je, tu, il/elle, etc.).
* **Key Concepts:** String manipulation (`substring`, `endsWith`), concatenation.

### 3. String Operations Menu (Exercise 3)
An interactive menu-driven program for processing text.
* **Features:**
    * **Enter:** Input a string.
    * **Display:** Show the current string.
    * **Reverse:** Print the string backwards using a manual loop.
    * **Word Count:** Count words by analyzing spaces and character transitions.
* **Key Concepts:** `switch` statements, `do-while` loops, algorithm design.

### 4. Character Frequency Analysis (Exercise 4)
A program that analyzes the frequency of letters in a text.
* **Features:**
    * Reads a line of text.
    * Counts occurrences of every letter (A-Z), ignoring case.
    * Displays the count for letters that appear at least once.
* **Key Concepts:** Arrays as counters, ASCII arithmetic, character class methods.
